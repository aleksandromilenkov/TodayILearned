I created React JS app called Today I Learned.
This app has a backend as well, I'm using the supabase.com free services to store my data.
In this app you can read facts from multiple topics. 
You can also add your fact by submiting the form for adding a new fact.
You can like, wow and dislike the facts and if the fact has more dislikes than likes that means that the fact maybe isn't true and it gets DISPUTED label on it.
You can check this app here: https://todayilearned-aleksandro.netlify.app/
